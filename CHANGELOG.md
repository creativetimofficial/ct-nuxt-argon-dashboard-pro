### Upgrade tips

- Copy over _components_ folder and _assets_ folder.
- Copy _dashboard-plugin.js_ and _globalComponents.js_ files.
- Add this code under `build` option in nuxt.config.js

```js
transpile: ["vee-validate/dist/rules"];
```

- Diff the package.json with yours to see which packages were upgraded.
- In your code, if you used the old vee-validate with `v-validate` directive, change it like this

This code

```html
<base-input
  v-validate="'required'"
  name="First Name"
  :error="getError('First Name')"
>
</base-input>
```

should be changed to

```{1}html
<base-input rules="required" name="First Name">
</base-input>
```

The `base-input` component can be used as a wrapper to validate any other custom component now.
For example, validating an element-ui select:

```{1}html
<base-input rules="required" name="My select">
 <el-select v-model="someValue">
 </el-select>
</base-input>
```
